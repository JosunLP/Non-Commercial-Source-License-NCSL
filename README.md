## 🔍 What counts as “Non‑Commercial”?

Non‑commercial means there’s no intent to obtain a commercial advantage or monetary compensation, direct or indirect. Examples:
- Personal learning, research, teaching, academic projects
- Hobby projects and internal evaluation
- Community demos without ads or monetization

Commercial use includes (examples, not exhaustive):
- Use in a for‑profit product or service
- SaaS, APIs, or apps that are paid, ad‑supported, or monetized in any way
- Consulting, freelancing, or client work using the software
- Use in production systems of entities pursuing profit

When in doubt, it’s commercial unless you have written permission.

## 🧩 Compatibility Notes

- This license is not compatible with OSI‑approved open‑source licenses for redistribution in a single combined work that would be distributed commercially.
- You may reference or link to this repository from open‑source projects; however, incorporating the code typically imposes NCSL terms on the combined work.

If you need broader rights, request a commercial license.

## 🆘 FAQ

- Is academic research allowed? Yes, if not monetized.
- Can I use it at my company for an internal tool? Not without permission (that’s commercial).
- Can I host a free demo site with no ads? Generally yes, if it’s truly non‑commercial.
- Can I run it on YouTube with monetized videos? That’s likely commercial — ask first.
- Can I relicense derivatives under an open‑source license? Not if you include NCSL code; the non‑commercial restriction must remain.
